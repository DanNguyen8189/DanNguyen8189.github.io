        <p>
            At the beginning of college, I wasn't sure if I was doing the right thing. I was coming
            in as a computer engineering major with no prior experience. As time progressed, however, I came
            to really enjoy software engineering and so I made the switch to computer science.
            <br/>
            I look forward to learning new things! Realizing the importance of pushing my boundaries, I joined 
            Engineers for a Sustainable World and eventually joined the UCSD Solar Car team, in which I became 
            software team co-lead as of November 2019.  
            <br/>
            In my spare time I love drawing. I'm always trying to improve at it! Art is never easy,
            but I enjoy it anyway. I also enjoy playing soccer and going for runs on the beach.
