            Hello! I'm Dan and I'm a recent graduate from UC San Diego with a B.S. in Computer Science. I have experience from school projects
            and outside projects such as UCSD Solar Car and this personal website.
            I'm currently looking for a full time permanent position or internship in software engineering!
            <br/>
            In my spare time I partake in a variety of hobbies and activites. I love drawing and posting my works on instagram and twitter. 
            I also enjoy playing soccer and learning to salsa dance!
